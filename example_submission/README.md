# Example submission

Here is an example submission folder. When making your own agent, you should construct a folder like this.

It will start with a script containing your agent and the means of training it or loading a trained agent. See `example_agent.py` for an example of this.

`example_agent.py` includes code that uses the `scripts/` scripts to create a submission file, `example_submission.py`. This doesn't need to be scripted, as the scripts can be used from the command line.
